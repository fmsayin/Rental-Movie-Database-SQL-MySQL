### 4c. 	Oh, no! The actor `HARPO WILLIAMS` was accidentally entered in the `actor` table as `GROUCHO WILLIAMS`, 
### the name of Harpo's second cousin's husband's yoga teacher. Write a query to fix the record.

UPDATE actor

### 4d. 	Perhaps we were too hasty in changing `GROUCHO` to `HARPO`. It turns out that `GROUCHO` was the correct name after all!
###     	In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently  `HARPO`, change it to `GROUCHO`. Otherwise, change the first
###     	name to `MUCHO GROUCHO`, as that is exactly what the actor will be with the grievous error. BE CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE FIRST
###     	NAME OF EVERY ACTOR TO `MUCHO GROUCHO`, HOWEVER! (Hint: update the record using a unique identifier.)
